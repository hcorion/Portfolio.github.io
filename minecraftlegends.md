I worked on Minecraft Legends as a Technical Designer, working on campaign and post-launch content. Here's a quick summary of some of my work:
- Worked on Minecraft Legends, using a custom engine with a custom scripting language.
- Overhauled three main campaign mid-game experiences, including scripting and level, combat and pacing design.
- Did a lot of work on our post-launch monthly game modes called "Lost Legends" including scripting and level, combat and pacing design.
- Owned a "Lost Legend" from concept to final, including scrpting and level, combat and economy design.
- Worked closely with numerous other depts including engineering, art, animation, vfx and cinematics to accomplish goals.
- Did script reviews with designers to ensure a consistent script quality across the project.
- Developed tools to help speed up designer workflows.
