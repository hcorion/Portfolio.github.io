I worked on Minecraft Legends as a Technical Designer at Blackbird Interactive working on campaign, Lost Legends and post-launch content. It shipped on PS4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, Nintendo Switch and PC.

# Campaign

## 3 Campaign Experiences

I overhauled three campaign mid-game experiences, including scripting and level, combat and pacing design.

Polished level and combat design on a key tutorial.

Rapidly onboarded onto the procedural rule-based level design workflow and ECS scripting system.

# Lost Legends

Responsible for supporting post-launch monthly game modes called "Lost Legends" including scripting and level, combat and pacing design.

Owned the Lost Legend The Treetop Trampoline... of DOOM! from concept to final, including scripting and level, combat and economy design.

Preformed script reviews with designers to ensure consistent script quality across the project.

Developed tools to help speed up designer workflows.

# Post-launch

Rebalanced numerous campaign experiences to align with a new vision for the game.

Revamped the design of the three mid-game experiences, iterating based on player feedback and new intentions to subtly tutorialize the experience.
