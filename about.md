Hi, I'm Zion, a Technical Designer. I've been passionate about game programming and design since I graduated with Honors from Vancouver Film School's Game Design program, and I'm actively working in the games industry, and so happy to be doing what I love.

I've worked mainly in Unity, Unreal and custom engines and eager to learn new tech. I love working in and learning different programming languages and I'm mainly familiar with C# and C++, but I've worked with Lua, Java, Rust, Nim, JavaScript, Bash among others.

You can contact me at zionnimchuk *[at]* gmail *[dot]* com.
