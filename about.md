Hi, I'm Zion, a Technical Designer and Game Programmer. I've been passionate about game programming and design since I was young, and I've been working on hobby projects and contributing to open source software for a while now. However, after dedicating a year of my life to Vancouver Film School's Game Design program, I'm ready to jump into the games industry!

I've worked mainly in Unity and Unreal, but I've experimented with small hobby engines and I love the challenge of learning a new engine. I love working in and learning different programming languages and I'm mainly familiar with C# and C++, but I've worked with Lua, Java, Rust, Nim, JavaScript, Bash among others.
