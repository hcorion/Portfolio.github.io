Hi, I'm Zion, a Game Programmer and Technical Designer. I've been passionate about game programming and design since I was young, and I've been working on hobby projects and contributing to open source software for a while now. I'm a graduate with Honors from Vancouver Film School's Game Design program, and I'm actively working in the games industry, and so happy to be doing what I love.

I've worked mainly in Unity and Unreal, but I've experimented with small hobby engines and I love the challenge of learning a new engine. I love working in and learning different programming languages and I'm mainly familiar with C# and C++, but I've worked with Lua, Java, Rust, Nim, JavaScript, Bash among others.

You can contact me at zionnimchuk *[at]* gmail *[dot]* com.
